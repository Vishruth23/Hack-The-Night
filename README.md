RVCE Hackathon - 15-June-2023

### **Bridging the NGO-Volunteer Gap**

Team members: Vishruth Vijay, Sathvik S Rao and Siddharth Menon

Aim: The aim of our app is to connect individuals, NGOs, volunteers, and donors in a user-friendly platform that facilitates easy engagement and collaboration for social causes. It strives to empower individuals to find meaningful volunteering opportunities, connect with NGOs aligned with their interests, and contribute to social impact through donations.

Our application has the following note-worthy features:

1) Platform for volunteers to find NGOs aligned to their interest: Our platform serves as a dynamic and inclusive space where volunteers can effortlessly discover NGOs that align with their specific interests and passions. We understand that each individual has unique causes they deeply care about, and our aim is to provide a streamlined solution that connects them with relevant organizations. Through our platform, volunteers can explore a diverse range of social causes, such as education, healthcare, environmental conservation, animal welfare, and more.

2) Event page where events can be viewed: This provides a platform for the NGOs to publicise the events that they carry out, this will inspire new volunteers to volunteer for a social cause. Our event page serves as a hub of inspiration and connection, empowering users to actively participate in events that align with their interests and contribute to the betterment of society.

3) Interactive chatbot: Our interactive chatbot is designed to provide instant assistance and cater to simple queries about the events hosted by NGOs. With a user-friendly interface, the chatbot serves as a virtual assistant, guiding users through event-related information and facilitating seamless communication. Users can ask questions about event schedules, locations, and any other relevant details. The chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing capabilities to understand user queries and provide accurate and timely responses.

### **Technologies used:**

1) Gensim,nltk and dateutil for natural language processing to answer queries related to an event
2) Selenium for webscraping and getting details of ngo's which haven't registered yet. These are then displayed on our site as a separate category, so that the volunteers have a hassle free experience in finding the NGO of their choice to donate.
3) Django for website development and sqlite3 for DB management. 

### **Future Scope**
Currently, our platform focuses on connecting users with NGOs based in Bangalore. However, we have ambitious plans to expand our geographical reach and include NGOs from various locations. Our goal is to create a global network of NGOs, enabling users to find volunteering opportunities and make a difference regardless of their location. 

To enhance user engagement, we are developing a chatbot that can handle more sophisticated questions beyond basic event inquiries. This intelligent chatbot will employ advanced algorithms and natural language processing to provide detailed and accurate responses, ensuring a seamless user experience. Additionally, we are implementing a rating and review system for NGOs, allowing users to provide feedback and share their experiences. This system will foster transparency and accountability, enabling users to make informed decisions when selecting NGOs to support or volunteer with. 

Through these enhancements, we strive to continuously improve our platform, expanding its reach, sophistication, and user satisfaction.
